# Day 2 – Conditional Logic

## What I Practiced
- Practiced conditional logic problems
- Learned how 'if-else' conditions work
- Understood how programs make decisions by comparing values

## Concepts Practiced
- if-else statements
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators

## Key Learning
This helped me understand how logical operators are applied in real programs.

## Practice Problem
I created a program that evaluates a student's result based on:
- Marks
- Attendance
- Bonus points

I also handled an edge case where bonus marks could exceed the maximum limit.
