# Day 8 – Tuples & Mini Project

## Topics Covered
- Tuples in Python
- Tuple indexing and slicing
- Tuple immutability
- Tuple methods
- Converting tuple to list and back
- Using tuples in programs
- Mini project using conditionals and lists

## Tuples in Python
- Tuples are ordered collections of data
- Tuples are immutable
- Elements are separated by commas and enclosed in ()
- A single-element tuple must contain a comma

## Tuple Operations Practiced
- Accessing elements using indexing
- Checking membership using `in`
- Slicing tuples
- Concatenating tuples
- Using `count()` and `index()` methods
- Converting tuple to list for modification
- Converting list back to tuple

## Key Learnings
- Tuples cannot be modified directly
- Lists are used when data needs to change
- Tuples are useful for fixed or constant data
- Slicing a tuple always returns a new tuple

## Mini Project
### Quiz Game (KBC-style)
- Displayed multiple-choice questions
- Took user input
- Used conditionals to validate answers
- Calculated total prize money
- Used lists to store options

## Practice Files
- practice/tuples.py
- projects/quiz_game.py

## Day 8 Status
✔ Learned tuples  
✔ Practiced tuple methods  
✔ Built a mini project  
✔ Strengthened conditionals and lists  

## Additional Mini Project – KBC Quiz Game

- Created a quiz game similar to KBC
- Stored questions, options, and answers using lists
- Used loops to iterate through questions
- Implemented quit option and prize tracking
- Displayed final take-home amount

### Concepts Applied
- Lists of lists
- Loop control
- Conditional statements
- User input handling
