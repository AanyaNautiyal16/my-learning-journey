# Day 5 – Strings (Slicing & Methods) + Loops

## Topics Covered
- String slicing (positive and negative indexing)
- String immutability
- Common string methods
- Using loops with strings

## Key Concepts
- Strings are immutable in Python
- Indexing starts from 0
- Negative indexing starts from -1 (last character)
- In slicing, the start index is included and the end index is excluded

## String Slicing Practice
- Practiced slicing using start and end indices
- Used negative indexing to access characters from the end
- Used len() to calculate slicing boundaries
- Verified slicing behavior without using len()

## String Methods Practiced
- upper()
- lower()
- rstrip()
- replace()
- split()
- capitalize()
- count()
- endswith()
- center()
- find()
- isalnum()
- isalpha()
- islower()
- isprintable()
- title()
- isspace()
- swapcase()

## Loops with Strings
- Iterated through strings using for loop
- Iterated through strings using while loop
- Combined string operations with loops

## Practice Files
- practice/strings.py
- practice/loops.py

## Key Takeaways
- Strings cannot be modified directly; methods return new strings
- Negative slicing is useful for accessing characters from the end
- find() is safer than index() when substring may not exist
- Loops allow character-by-character string processing
- Match Case Statements (a new addition from python 10 onwards)
- Switch case statements were not available in python before python 10
